# Pittsburgh-Parks-Conservancy-Capstone-Project
This is project I completed during my Quantitative Economics Program at the University of Pittsburgh,
We wanted to visualize/ quantify park visitation from different parts of the city and explore some of the factors that influence park visitation
In order to run the file to get the maps you will need a Census API key which can be obtained for free at https://api.census.gov/
